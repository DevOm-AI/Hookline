# Hookline

A webhook delivery service that doesn't lose events.

> Work in progress. The full README (architecture, design decisions, chaos test results) comes later.

## Run locally

Requires Docker and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
Health check: http://localhost:8000/health

Migrations run automatically: the `migrate` service applies `alembic upgrade head`
before the api, worker and beat start.

## Migrations

Run Alembic inside a container, where `DATABASE_URL` points at the `postgres` service:

```bash
# After changing models in app/models/
docker compose run --rm api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the change"
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head
docker compose run --rm api alembic current
```

New migration files land in `alembic/versions/`. Format and review them before committing:

```bash
uv run ruff format alembic/versions && uv run ruff check alembic/versions
```

## Tests and lint

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
```
